# Hindustan Unilever – DCF Valuation (May 2025)
This project performs a full discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Hindustan Unilever using a structured, bottom-up forecasting model. The analysis builds long-term projections for sales, EBITDA, FCFF, and intrinsic value per share under base-case operating assumptions.

The valuation incorporates detailed reinvestment analysis, return on invested capital (ROIC), long-term growth dynamics, capital structure, and weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  
All computations are supported by separate PDFs containing the valuation and WACC calculations.

# Project Objective
To estimate the intrinsic value of **Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL)** as of May 2025 using a DCF methodology, and determine whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its prevailing market price.

# Key Valuation Findings
### Intrinsic Value Estimate — Base Case
* Enterprise Value (EV): ₹310,479.9 Cr  
* Equity Value: ₹316,385.9 Cr  
* Intrinsic Value per Share: **₹1,346.6**  
* Market Price (28 May 2025): ₹2,372.0  
* Implied Overvaluation: **76.15%**

The model indicates that **Hindustan Unilever is significantly overvalued** at current market levels under the base-case scenario.

# Modeling Framework

## 1. Revenue, EBITDA & EPS Forecasts
Long-term forecasts incorporate historical performance and scenario-based growth assumptions.

### Sales Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* Revenue growth moderates from ~8% (2026E) to ~4.5% (2032E).

### EBITDA Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* EBITDA grows from ~₹5,910 Cr (2016A) to ~₹23,600 Cr (2032E).

### EPS Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* EPS grows from ₹16.9 (2016A) to ₹64.7 (2032E).

## 2. Reinvestment & ROIC
A reinvestment analysis computes how efficiently capital is deployed.

* 10-year median reinvestment rate: ~2.09%  
* 10-year median intrinsic growth rate: ~4.89%  
* ROIC consistently above 20% in most years.

## 3. Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
Formula: **FCFF = NOPAT + Depreciation − Capex − ΔWorking Capital**

### Base-Case FCFF Forecast (2026–2030E)
* 2026E: ₹14,856.5 Cr  
* 2027E: ₹16,288.9 Cr  
* 2028E: ₹18,071.8 Cr  
* 2029E: ₹21,001.2 Cr  
* 2030E: ₹25,421.1 Cr  

### Terminal Value (TV)
* Terminal growth rate (g): 2%  
* TV: ₹367,120.6 Cr  
* PV of TV: ₹237,915.3 Cr  

### Sum of PVs
* PV of FCFF (2026E–2030E): ₹72,564.6 Cr

## 4. WACC Calculation
Key inputs:
* Cost of Equity: 9.11%  
* Post-Tax Cost of Debt: 5.57%  
* Equity Weight: 98.62%  
* Debt Weight: 1.38%  
* **WACC: 9.06%**

# Sensitivity Analysis
The valuation is sensitive to:
* WACC variations  
* Terminal growth rate (TGR)  
* Margin and reinvestment assumptions  

Small changes in WACC or terminal growth can materially affect intrinsic value due to high dependence on terminal value.

# Conclusion
The May 2025 DCF valuation shows that **Hindustan Unilever’s stock price materially exceeds its intrinsic value**, driven by high market expectations relative to underlying cash flow generation.

This project demonstrates:
* End-to-end valuation modeling  
* Scenario-based forecasting  
* Peer-comparable WACC computation  
* FCFF and terminal value modeling  
* Sensitivity-driven valuation insights
